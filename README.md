Machine Learning course project:

Using Knime Analytic Platform perform machine learning based analysis on Low Back Pain diagnosis.

# ABSTRACT

The treatment and prevention of low back pain remains a challenge for primary care internationally as
it is considered the second most widespread disease worldwide. Through some indicators it is possible to identify
abnormalities in the spine, the main factor in causing low back pain. The purpose of this study is to
create a classification model to identify the presence of abnormalities in the lumbar and sacral area of the
vertebral column. Through heuristic, probabilistic, separation and regression models and through several
methods of selection and extraction of the variables it was possible to arrive at a classification with precision
88%. Furthermore, a set of 3 variables was obtained which is able to classify the presence of anomalies with sufficient
precision. Never before had such a low level of variables been reached in the studies compared.
